# Project-SERVE (CS 338)
Repository Template for our CS Final Project. 

## Tech Stack
**Tech Stack Idea**
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** SQlite (if it limits us after construction of the ER diagram, we can consider MySQL)

**Reasoning:**
- **Streamlit:** easy to get the frontend working. Has prebuilt components and widgets for common tasks like adding buttons, sliders, text inputs. Jaden has working experience with it, so we will have some familiarity
- **Flask:** Jaden has working experience with Flask. I also have little Python web-dev experience so I can try to learn some Flask to code.
- **SQlite:** It is easy, very little configuration, recommended by the Project Document (CS 338), and is sheareable! 

## Note on Naming Commits
It would awesome if we could all write commit messages before pushing code changes/PRs, as it would help us know what the change is for!

**Example:** "_Wrote logic for button on home page_" or "_Added small HTML header for subtitle_"

## Note on Pull Requests
A Pull Request ensures someone doesn't directly push into our main code, which is all stored in the "main" branch. It is a method to propose changes to the codebase and have it reviewed (errors etc.) before being pushed. 

I enabled every PR to have **at least 1 required approval** so someone can take a look. For project simplicity, I was thinking of **only using the "main"** branch. 

My reasoning to having branch protection is to avoid someone accidentally deleting code or pushing code with errors etc, but nothing more than that. 

_If anyone dislikes the general PR approach and wants to directly push without any review, we can all re-decide as a team!_
