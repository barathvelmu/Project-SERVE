## Tech Stack
**Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** SQlite

## Running the Project
1. Ensure that you have all of the libraries installed as described in requirements.txt
2. Open Command Prompt / Terminal. Navigate to the "App" folder in the repository.
3. Launch the Flask API by running the command `python -m flask --app api run`.
4. Once the Flask API is running, open a new instance of Command Prompt / Terminal (keep the previous instance open). Navigate to the "App" folder and launch the Streamlit frontend by running the command `python -m streamlit run Tabs.py`.

**Please ensure that the file structure in the App folder is unchanged. Both the Flask API and the Streamlit frontend rely on the folder structure in order to run.**
